# Django For Beginners Chapter 3: Pages app

In this chapter I learn how to use the built in templates provided by Django to render HTML pages.

The templating language is weird but it's all I got for now.

I have to set up these things to make this all work:
1. setting up urls.py file in the project level that points to the pages app
2. setting up the urls.py file in the app level that points to the views
3. setting up the views.py file to point to the html templates that render out the webpage

Still very simple and easy to understand.
